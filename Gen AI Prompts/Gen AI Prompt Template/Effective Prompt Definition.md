## Effective Prompt Definition:
An effective prompt should clearly define the task, provide necessary context, specify the desired output format, and may also include examples or constraints to guide the AI's response.

Here's a breakdown of these effective prompt components:

**Task:**
Clearly state what you want the AI to do. Be specific and avoid ambiguity. *For example, instead of "write a story," specify "write a short story about a cat and a dog who become friends."*

**Context:**
Provide background information or relevant details that the AI needs to understand the task. This helps the AI generate more accurate and relevant responses. *For example, if you're asking for a summary of a document, include the document's title or topic.*

**Output Format:**
Specify how you want the AI to present the information. This could include the desired format (e.g., paragraph, bullet points, table), length, or style.

**Examples:**
If possible, include examples of the desired output. This can be particularly helpful for tasks like code generation or creative writing.

**Constraints:**
If there are any limitations or restrictions on the output, clearly state them in the prompt. This could include length limits, specific keywords to include or exclude, or tone/style guidelines.

**Persona/Role:**
If the AI is meant to respond as a specific person or entity, specify that in the prompt. *For example, "Act as a professional copywriter."*

**Expectations:**
Clearly articulate what you expect the AI to do. For example, whether you want it to explain its reasoning, provide a summary, or offer a solution.

**Source:**
If you are referring to specific sources, data or plugins, mention them in the prompt to guide the AI to the right information.
